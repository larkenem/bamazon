# bamazon
Amazon-like store front app that utilizes MySQL technology and the Inquirer and MySQL NPM packages.

The app will take in orders from customers and deplete stock from the store's inventory.

Initializing node bamazon.js in the command line brings up the item list. You will be asked what you'd like to purchase by item number and then how many.

If there are enough then it will adjust the quantities and continue and if there are not enough, an error message will populate.
